# Troubleshooting Python Deep Learning [Video]
This is the code repository for [Troubleshooting Python Deep Learning [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/troubleshooting-python-deep-learning-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788998192), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Building Deep Learning models with Python is a strenuous task and there are chances of getting stuck at specific tasks. When that happens you usually tend to end up searching for solutions and need to manually look for ways to come out of these problems. This wastes both time and effort and may also lead to the lower performance of your Deep Learning system.

After carefully analysing the most popular errors or problems arising while working on Deep Learning models, we have identified the most usable models which are used for classification and have provided practical yet unique solutions to each problem that is easy to understand and implement. You could either follow the entire course or could directly jump into the section that covers a specific problem that you are facing. Some of the common yet important issues we would be covering are about errors while building and training deep learning with neural networks, especially without a specific framework.

By the end of the course, you would be well versed to tackle and troubleshoot any errors with your Deep learning Models.
